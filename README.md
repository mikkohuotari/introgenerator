# introgenerator

## What?

Create animated intros or backgrounds with barebones CSS.

## Why would I do that?

No dedicated video production personnel in-house? 

Editing software licenses limited? 

No problem! 

Use this to create somewhat interesting looking intros on-demand. 

Dunno, this seemed like a fun experiment to recycle some animations created in various projects.

## How 

1. Drop SharpSansDispNo1-Bold.otf file in folder
2. Open text-intro.html

## What's next

Making different intros and background loops, I guess.

Something more dynamic and flexible codebase would be useful for more complex stuff.
